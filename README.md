# You-market

 # *Project Subject*

  The idea of my project consists in creating a web application named { **You Market** } whose theme is centered on the operations of sales of products which can be old or new in order to answer the problem which finds this type of sellers by facilitating the communication and offers a market space for everyone who wishes to list/buy a product, vehicle, home rental, where the user can create those for sale (***listings***), or purchase one or more, he can see his profile, his statistics.
